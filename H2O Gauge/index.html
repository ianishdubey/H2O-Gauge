      Welcome to Aqua meter, a website that helps you understand how much water you use and how you can reduce your
      impact on the environment. Water is a vital resource for life, but it is also scarce and unevenly distributed
      around the world. Many of the goods and services we consume require a lot of water to produce, and some of them
      come from places where water is already scarce or polluted.
