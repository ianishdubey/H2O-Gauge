      <h1> About Us </h1>
      <p> Welcome to Water Footprint, a website that helps you understand how much water you use and how you can reduce
        your impact on the environment. Water is a vital resource for life, but it is also scarce and unevenly
        distributed around the world. Many of the goods and services we consume require a lot of water to produce, and
        some of them come from places where water is already scarce or polluted. By calculating your water footprint,
        you can learn how much water you use directly and indirectly, and where it comes from. You can also compare your
        water footprint with the global average and see how you can make more sustainable choices.​</p>
